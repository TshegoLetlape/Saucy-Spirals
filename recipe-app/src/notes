A. Pasta bake with sausage

- What you'll need:

  - pasta - use penne, but you can use the more traditional ziti pasta. But really any kind of smaller pasta will work here such as elbow pasta, rotini, or farfalle.
  - olive oil
  - Italian sausage - you could use any kind of ground meat as well, such as ground beef, pork, turkey, or chicken. You may have to increase the amount of Italian seasoning used to compensate for the flavours in Italian sausage.
  - onion
  - garlic
  - tomato sauce
  - herbs - I used Italian seasoning, fresh parsley and fresh basil.
  - cheese - Parmesan and mozzarella cheese.
  - salt and pepper.

  How to make Pasta bake with sausage:

  1.  Boil the pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm), about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.
  2.  Cook the sausage. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large pot (or 4 qt. Dutch oven) for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the hot oil sizzles. Add sausage and stir to cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Use a spatula to break the sausages into small pieces. Add onions and garlic and sauté until soft and tender, about 2-3 minutes. Stir to combine.
  3.  Make the sauce. Pour in tomato sauce, turn the heat down to medium, and bring the meat sauce to a simmer, stirring occasionally. Stir in Italian seasoning, ½ cup Parmesan cheese, parsley and basil. Season with salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Simmering helps develop richer flavour in the sauce.
  4.  Add the pasta. Transfer the cooked and drained pasta into the sauce and toss well to mix evenly.
  5.  Assemble. Spread half of the pasta into a 9x13 casserole pan and top with half of mozzarella cheese (1.5 cups). Add the remaining pasta and sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese evenly on top.
  6.  Bake. Bake the pasta in a 375F preheated oven for 25 minutes until the melted cheese is golden brown. Let cool for 15 minutes, then serve.

B.Pesto Penne Pasta
What you'll need:
-penne pasta - or substitute with your favourite kind of pasta. I like the penne shape because it traps so much delicious sauce inside.

- basil pesto - it's really easy to make fresh basil pesto homemade in just 5 minutes, or you can easily use store-bought pesto as well.
- cherry tomatoes
- Parmesan cheese
- salt and pepper

How to makethe penne pasta.
1.Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add penne pasta and a little bit salt, and cook till al dente (fully cooked but still firm) about 8-10 minutes, or according to package directions. Do not overcook the pasta. Turn off the heat and reserve at least ¼ cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta in a colander and let it cool for 1 minute.
2.Toss in pesto. Transfer pasta into a large mixing bowl and add pesto and reserved pasta water (¼ cup or more, if desired). Season with salt and pepper and toss well to coat. Stir in cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese. 3. Serve. Serve immediately. Sprinkle extra parmesan on top, if desired.

C. Creamy Tomato Pasta
What you'll need:

- pasta - use your favorite pasta shape. Penne, rotini, or cavatappi are great shapes for holding sauce.
- butter - you can use olive oil instead or a plant-based butter substitute if you are vegan.
- garlic - use fresh garlic if you can, or make it easier by using 1 teaspoon of pre-minced garlic in place of each garlic clove used here.
- tomato sauce - homemade and store-bought both work.
- tomato paste - you can use tomato puree in place of tomato paste at a 3:1 ratio.
- heavy cream - you can also try a heavy coconut cream if you prefer to make it a little lighter, but it will change the taste of the pasta making it slightly sweeter.
- Parmesan cheese - Parmesan cheese adds a rich, nutty flavor to the sauce and helps to thicken it. Asiago or pecorino romano are both great swaps for Parmesan.
- salt and pepper
- fresh parsley - highly recommended for serving on top, but you can leave it out if you don't like parsley. Chopped basil works well too.

How to make Creamy Tomato Pasta:

1.  Cook pasta. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 minutes or according to package directions. Drain the pasta well and set aside.

What you'll need:

- fettuccine noodles - this traditional dish is made with fettuccine noodles. But you can substitute with any long noodles that you have such as spaghetti or linguine.
- salt

- garlic - we recommend fresh garlic for the strongest flavor. You can substitute with garlic powder if you don’t have fresh garlic on hand.

E. Creamy White Chicken and Spinach lasagna
What You'll Need:

- lasagna layer - lasagna noodles boiled in olive oil and salt.
- creamy spinach white sauce layer - olive oil, onion, garlic, chicken broth (or 1 tablespoon chicken bouillon powder + 1 cup water), all-purpose flour (or cornstarch), heavy cream and fresh baby spinach.
- chicken layer - 1 pound or 3 cups of shredded chicken. You can use a storebought rotisserie chicken or make your own. My favourite recipes to use are dutch oven whole roast chicken, roasted spatchcock chicken or Greek lemon garlic whole roast chicken. A slow cooker whole chicken would also work beautifully.
- cheese layer - ricotta cheese. mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and parsley.
- shredded cheese layer on top - mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.

How to make Creamy White Chicken and Spinach Lasagna:

1.  Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium high heat. Add lasagna noodles, olive oil and salt and cook until al dente (fully cooked but still firm), or according to package directions, about 10 minutes. Rinse the noodles under cold water to stop the cooking process and set aside in the pot.
2.  Heat oil in a large saucepan for 2 minutes over medium-high heat until the oil is sizzling hot. Add onion and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken broth and flour and whisk until smooth and uniform. The sauce might initially be a little clumpy. Whisk in heavy cream and bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat. Let it simmer, stirring occasionally until thickened, about 5-8 minutes. The sauce should be similar in consistency to a gravy and be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Remove from heat and stir in spinach. Set aside.
3.  In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan, beaten egg, and parsley. Stir well to combine together. Set aside.

F.Cheesy Tortellini:

G.Shrimp Alfredo
What you'll need:
-Fettuccine - alfredo is traditionally made with fettuccine noodles, but you can use your favorite shape of pasta. Linguine and spaghetti noodles are both common substitutes for fettuccine — just follow the cooking time on the package.
-butter - use unsalted butter for the most control over the flavor. For a more lactose-friendly version, use a vegan butter substitute instead.
-garlic - freshly minced garlic yields the best flavor, but you can use pre-minced garlic at a ratio of ½-1 teaspoon per clove of garlic called for in this recipe.
-vegetable stock - you can use homemade or store-bought stock! You can also try seafood stock or make your own from the shells of the shrimp for a richer seafood flavor.
-heavy cream - if you don’t have heavy cream on hand, use an equal amount of whole milk or half-and-half. If you or someone in your family has a dairy sensitivity, try coconut milk or cream instead.

- large shrimp - shrimp from the seafood counter or frozen shrimp are both fine to use — just make sure they’re thawed, peeled, deveined, and tails removed before cooking.
- parmesan cheese - Asiago or pecorino romano would work well in place of the parmesan. You can also use a vegan - -parmesan-style alternative or nutritional yeast.
- parsley - out of fresh parsley? Try using dried parsley or other fresh soft herbs like dill or basil!
- salt and pepper
